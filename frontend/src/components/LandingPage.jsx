              Good nutrition can help you shed excess pounds â€” without food
              cravings or feeling hungry! This is because healthy foods are
              packed with nutrients.What's more,high-nutrition foods also
              require more chewing, slowing you down and helping you eat more
              mindfully. As a result, your body has a chance to send the signals
              to the brain that let you know when you're full. Good nutrition
              also means you can eat more of the healthy foods you love.
